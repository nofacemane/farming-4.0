# farming-4.0
Blending Computer Science with Agriculture

Precision Agriculture is a technology-based farming technique aimed at gathering accurate measurements to improve crop management systems as well as provide nutrient-based analytics - two contributing factors ensuring crop production is maximized.

This project aims to go beyond Precision Agriculture by entering into the space of Farming 4.0, which includes the use of 4IR technologies, as we seek to further improve and innovate current farming practices. This includes the use of UGVs, UAVs, image processing through machine learning, and the identification of ‘hidden’ patterns in massive data buckets collected from the imagery database.
